# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


The skim function was useful for understanding the variable types and checking for missing values. 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
skim(alcohol_direct)

# There are two variable types, numeric and character. The country column is a character type and the other four column (beer, wine, spirit, and total) are numeric. 
# No missing values to worry about. 

```

Plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
top_25_beer <- glimpse(alcohol_direct) %>%
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
  slice(1:25)

ggplot(top_25_beer, aes(x =fct_reorder(country,beer_servings),y=beer_servings))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, size = 5),axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries", x= "Countries", y= "Beer Servings" )+
  NULL
  
  

```

Plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

top_25_wine <- glimpse(alcohol_direct) %>%
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
  slice(1:25)

ggplot(top_25_wine, aes(x =fct_reorder(country,wine_servings),y=wine_servings))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, size = 5),axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries", x= "Countries", y= "Wine Servings" )+
  NULL


```

Plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}

top_25_spirit <- glimpse(alcohol_direct) %>%
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
  slice(1:25)

ggplot(top_25_spirit, aes(x =fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings),y=spirit_servings))+
  geom_col()+
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, size = 5),axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries", x= "Countries", y= "Spirit Servings" )+
  NULL


```

The graphs depict that, on average, Namibians consumer the most beer, the French consume the most wine, and Grenadians consume the most spirits. These results may be a consequence of availability of particular ingredients (sugarcane,hops, barley, grapes), implications of specific climates, or cultural influences. Other countries have increasingly stringent or relaxed regulations on the different types of alcohol which alter the consumption habits of consumers.  

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

This loads the dataset movies.

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} 
movies <- read_csv("movies.csv")
glimpse(movies)



```

Skim was used to check for missing value, of which there were no missing values. However, there are duplicate values for the three character type columns.

```{r, skim_values}
skim(movies)

```

This is used for displaying a series of tables concerning movies. 

```{r, gross_on_fblikes_table}
# Table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  count(sort = TRUE)

# Table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(mean_budget = mean(budget), mean_gross_earning = mean(gross), return_on_budget = mean_gross_earning/mean_budget) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

# Table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office

top_15_directors <- movies %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(mean_director = mean(gross), standard_dev = sd(gross), median = median(gross), total = sum(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  slice(1:15)

top_15_directors

# Table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre.
rating <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(min = min(rating), max = max(rating), median = median(rating), standard_dev = sd(rating))
  
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating))+
  geom_density()+
  labs(title = "Ratings Density", colour = rating)

```

  We have placed "gross" on the y-axis and "cast_facebook_likes" on the x-axis. The amount of Facebook likes the cast has received is likely not the strongest indicator of high gross revenues.
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y= gross))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()

```
  
  The correlation between gross revenues and budget seems to be stronger than the previous correlation with Facebook likes. 

```{r, gross_on_budget}


ggplot(movies, aes(x = gross, y= budget))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()

```
  
  There seems to be a small relationship between gross revenue and rating when faceted by genre. Depending on the genre the correlation slightly changes, or there isn't enough data in particular genres to make a determination.  

```{r, gross_on_rating}


ggplot(movies, aes(x = gross, y= rating))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(vars(genre))+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()

```

Returns of financial stocks

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv("nyse.csv")
```

Table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

chart_sector <- nyse %>% 
  group_by (sector) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_companies = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_of_companies))

ggplot (chart_sector, aes( x = fct_reorder(sector, -number_of_companies), y = number_of_companies))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Companies Per Sector", x= "Sector", y= "Number Per Sector" )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

Gathers the tickers from Wikipedia

```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Price data on stocks

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Calculation of different return periods

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Summarized monthly returns since 2017-01-01 for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

summarise_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  dplyr::group_by(symbol) %>%
  dplyr::filter(date >= as.Date("2017-01-01")) %>%
  summarise(min_return = min(monthly_returns), max_return = max(monthly_returns), median_return = median(monthly_returns), mean_return = mean(monthly_returns), std_return = sd(monthly_returns))

summarise_monthly_returns

```

Density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns}

ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes( x = monthly_returns)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  labs(title = "Density plot of the distribution of monthly returns",
    y = "Density", x = "Monthly Returns") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, face = "bold"))

```

We can infer from the plot that the "SPY" is the lest risky since the monthly return distribution is the most narrow, whereas the "DOW" has the widest distribution making it the most risky. 

Plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis.

```{r risk_return_plot}

myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(monthly_returns),sd=sd(monthly_returns)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sd,y=mean,label=symbol)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(show.legend = FALSE,size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Expected Monthly Returns vs Risk ",
    y = "Expected monthly returns",
    x = "Risk") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = "bold"))

```

From this plot we can say that usually when the risk is low the expected monthly return is also low (e.g. SPY, JNJ) and vice versa (e.g. AAPL, CRM). However, DOW is risky but the expected monthly return is not very high. On the other hand, V, UNH and NKE have high expected return compared to their risk profile. 

# On your own: IBM HR Analytics

For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.

# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
        select(Year:Dec) %>%
        pivot_longer(cols=2:13, names_to="Month", values_to="delta")

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  labs (title = "Weather Anomalies")

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method="loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )     

```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use?
  
  filter(interval=="2011-present")%>%
  
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  
  summarize(mean_delta=mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE), 
    SD_delta=sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE), 
    count_delta=n(), 
    se_delta=SD_delta/sqrt(count_delta), 
    t_critical=qt(0.975,count_delta-1), 
    Lower_CI=mean_delta-t_critical*se_delta, upper_CI=mean_delta+t_critical*se_delta)

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

library(infer)

bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>%
            filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
            specify(response = delta) %>%
            generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>%
            calculate(stat = "mean") 

bootstrap_CI <- bootstrap_delta %>%
            get_ci(level=0.95, type = "percentile") #only work with bootstrap

bootstrap_CI

```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

We used two methods to calculate the 95% confidence interval of temperature anomalies. Essentially, this confidence interval indicates the range of values for which we are 95% certain that they contain the true 'population' mean. The first method uses a student-t distribution to standard deviations and the t-critical values that correspond to the 95% interval. This calculation yielded a lower bound of 0.916 and an upper bound of 1.02, meaning the true mean temperature deviation from 2011 onward is between these values with 95% confidence. The second method uses a bootstrap calculation to find the confidence interval. We set the number of repeats to 1000 and this yielded a confidence interval of 0.914 to 1.02. Overall, the two confidence intervals are very similar and they indicate that temperature anomalies since 2011 have been close to unitary, which is extremely significant according to the NASA website. 

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}

gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.

```{r, clean_data}
#addition of new column that shows who uses either or both platforms, none, or didnt proivde data (Yes, No, NA)
gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta= ifelse(snapchat=="Yes" | instagrm =="Yes", "Yes", ifelse(snapchat== "NA" & instagrm== "NA", "NA", "No")))

gss
```


1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.

```{r, prop_yes}
# this variable counts all people who sumbitted an answer 
sum_users_answer <- sum(gss$snap_insta!= "NA")

#this calculates the proportion of people using platforms (Yes/(Yes+No))
prop_yes_gss <-  gss %>% 
  summarise(prop_yes = (sum(ifelse(snap_insta=="Yes", 1, 0))/sum_users_answer))
                        
prop_yes_gss
```

1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram

```{r, snap_insta}

#women who use either Snapchat or Instagram

#sum for women who use either Snapchat or Instagram
sum_women_snap_insta <- sum(gss$snap_insta != "NA" & gss$sex=="Female") 

#proportion of women using platforms (Yes/(Yes+No))
prop_yes_gss_women <-  gss %>% 
  filter (sex=="Female") %>%
  summarise(prop_yes = (sum(ifelse(snap_insta=="Yes", 1, 0))/sum_women_snap_insta))
                        
#standard erros and the average for women 
stan_error_women <- sqrt(prop_yes_gss_women*(1-prop_yes_gss_women)/ (sum_women_snap_insta))
mean_snap_insta_women <- prop_yes_gss_women 

#CI of 95% for women who use either Snapchat or Instagram
critical_t_value <- qt(0.975,  sum_women_snap_insta -1)
lower_CI_women <- mean_snap_insta_women - (critical_t_value*stan_error_women)
upper_CI_women <- mean_snap_insta_women + (critical_t_value*stan_error_women)


#men who use either Snapchat or Instagram

#sum for men who use either Snapchat or Instagram
sum_men_snap_insta <- sum(gss$snap_insta != "NA" & gss$sex=="Male") 

#proportion of men using platforms (yes/(yes+no))
prop_yes_gss_men <-  gss %>% 
  filter (sex=="Male") %>%
  summarise(prop_yes = (sum(ifelse(snap_insta=="Yes", 1, 0))/sum_men_snap_insta))
                        
#standard erros and the average for men 
stan_error_men <- sqrt(prop_yes_gss_men*(1-prop_yes_gss_men)/ (sum_men_snap_insta))
mean_snap_insta_men <- prop_yes_gss_men

#CI of 95% for men who use either Snapchat or Instagram
critical_t_value <- qt(0.975,  sum_men_snap_insta -1)
lower_CI_men <- mean_snap_insta_men - (critical_t_value*stan_error_men)
upper_CI_men <- mean_snap_insta_men + (critical_t_value*stan_error_men)

#print CI of 95% for women and men
paste("Proportion of women using either Snapchat or Instagram:", prop_yes_gss_women)
paste("CI 95% women:", "[", lower_CI_women, "-", upper_CI_women, "]")
paste("Proportion of men using either Snapchat or Instagram:", prop_yes_gss_men)
paste("CI 95% men:", "[", lower_CI_men, "-", upper_CI_men, "]")
```


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 


```{r, twitter}

twitter <- gss %>%
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, levels=c("NA","Lt high school", "High school", 
                                          "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate"), ordered=TRUE)
         )
```

1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.

```{r, twitter2}

twitter_new <- twitter %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = ifelse(degree=="Bachelor" | degree =="Graduate", "Yes",
                                    ifelse(degree== "NA", NA_character_, "No")))
```


1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r, twitter3}

twitter_graduate <- twitter_new %>% 
  filter (bachelor_graduate == "Yes")

count_twitter <- count(twitter_graduate$twitter=="Yes") + count(twitter_graduate$twitter=="No")
  
prop_twitter <- twitter_graduate %>% 
  summarise(prop_twitter_graduate_yes = (sum(ifelse(twitter=="Yes", 1, 0))/count_twitter))
```


1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r, twitter4}

#standard error and mean of people who have a bachelor or graduate and use twitter
stan_error_twitter_yes <- sqrt(prop_twitter*(1-prop_twitter)/(count_twitter))
mean_twitter_yes <- prop_twitter

#CI of 95% of people who have a bachelor or graduate and use twitter
critical_t_value <- qt(0.975,  count_twitter -1)
lower_CI_yes <- mean_twitter_yes - critical_t_value*stan_error_twitter_yes
upper_CI_yes <- mean_twitter_yes + critical_t_value*stan_error_twitter_yes



#standard error and mean of people who have a bachelor or graduate and don't use twitter
stan_error_twitter_no <- sqrt((1-prop_twitter)*(1-(1-prop_twitter))/(count_twitter))
mean_twitter_no <- 1-prop_twitter

#CI of 95% of people who have a bachelor or graduate and don't use twitter
critical_t_value <- qt(0.975,  count_twitter -1)
lower_CI_no <- mean_twitter_no - critical_t_value*stan_error_twitter_no
upper_CI_no <- mean_twitter_no + critical_t_value*stan_error_twitter_no

#proportion women and men and CIs for 95%
paste("Proportion of graduates using twitter:", prop_twitter$prop_twitter_graduate_yes)
paste("CI 95% of graduates using twitter:", "[" , lower_CI_yes, "-", upper_CI_yes, "]")
paste("Proportion of graduates not using twitter:", 1-prop_twitter$prop_twitter_graduate_yes)
paste("CI 95% graduates not using twitter:", "[", lower_CI_no, "-", upper_CI_no, "]")

```

1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

These two Confidence Intervals don't overlap. With 95% confidence we can say that there is a difference between the proportion of graduates using twitter compared to those who don't use it. The proportion of graduates using twitter is lower than the proportion of graduates not using it. 

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.

```{r, email} 

email <- gss %>%
  mutate(emailmin = as.numeric(emailmin), emailhr = as.numeric(emailhr)) %>% 
  mutate(email = (emailhr * 60) + emailmin)

```


1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?

```{r, email2}

email_user <- email%>%
   filter (email != "NA_character_") %>%
    summarise(mean_email = mean (email), median_email = median (email)) 

```

The median is a better measure of the typical amount of time Americans spend on email weekly because there are many outliers and thus the mean doesn't represent a precise value - the standard deviation is high as well as the mean (compared to the median). 

1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.

```{r, email3}

library(infer)

boot_email <- email %>%
  filter(email != "NA_character_") %>%
  
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(response = email) %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of bootstrap samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  # Find the mean of each sample
  calculate(stat ="mean") 

percentile_ci <- boot_email %>%
get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

# Report endpoints in "humanized" units (using arithmetic operators %/% and %%)
percentile_ci_new_lower_hour <- percentile_ci$lower_ci%/%60 
percentile_ci_new_lower_minute <- percentile_ci$lower_ci%%60    
percentile_ci_new_upper_hour <- percentile_ci$upper_ci%/%60 
percentile_ci_new_upper_minute <- percentile_ci$upper_ci%%60   

paste(percentile_ci_new_lower_hour, "hours and", 
      format(round(percentile_ci_new_lower_minute), 
             nsmall = 0) , "minutes")
paste(percentile_ci_new_upper_hour, "hours and", 
      format(round(percentile_ci_new_upper_minute), 
             nsmall = 0) , "minutes")
```


1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

We would expect a 99% Confidence Interval to be wider than the interval calculated above, because the margin of error would increase and result in a wider interval. We would then predict the population parameter with 99% confidence. 

# Trump's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
library(lubridate)

approval_polllist_cleaned <- approval_polllist %>%
    filter(subgroup=="Voters")%>%
    mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), 
           startdate = mdy(startdate), 
           enddate=mdy(enddate),
           createddate=mdy(createddate), 
           timestamp=parse_date_time(timestamp, orders="HMSdmy")
           )

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r, weekly_approval_trump_plot}

trump_net_approval <- approval_polllist_cleaned %>%
  mutate (net_approval_rate = (approve - disapprove), 
          end_week = isoweek(enddate), year =year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(year, end_week) %>% 
  summarize(mean_net = mean(net_approval_rate)) %>% 
  ungroup()

trump_net_approval_CI<- approval_polllist_cleaned %>%
  mutate (net_approval_rate = (approve - disapprove), 
          end_week = isoweek(enddate), year =year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(year, end_week) %>% 
  summarize(mean_net = mean(net_approval_rate), 
            std_trump = sd(net_approval_rate), 
            count_endweek=n(),
            st_error_trump = std_trump/sqrt(count_endweek), 
            t_critical = qt(0.975,  count_endweek-1), 
            lower_CI = mean_net - t_critical*st_error_trump, 
            upper_CI = mean_net + t_critical*st_error_trump)

ggplot(trump_net_approval_CI, aes(x=end_week, y=mean_net, color=as.factor(year))) +
  facet_wrap(vars(year)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymax = upper_CI , ymin =  lower_CI), size=0) +
  geom_point(size=0.75) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype="solid", color = "orange") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = upper_CI))+
  geom_line(aes(y = lower_CI))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower_CI,ymax=upper_CI), alpha=0.2) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title ="Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", 
       subtitle ="Weekly average of all polls", x="Week of year",
       y = "Average Net Approval (%) ") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(digits = 1)) + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "whitesmoke"), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "whitesmoke"), 
        legend.position = "none") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-20,0, -17.7,-15.0,-12.5,-10.0,-7.5,-5.0,-2.5,0.0,2.5,5.0,7.5))+
    scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(0,13, 26, 39, 52)) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("#FF736C", "#7DAE00", "#00BBBD", "#C47EFF"))


```

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "trump_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

In week 15 of 2020, the mean net approval rate is -7.1 with 95% CI interval -8.21 and -5.99, while in week 34, the mean net approval rate is -10.91 with 95% CI interval -13.49 and -8.34. The mean net approval rate is lower and the confidence interval is wider in week 34, meaning that more people disapproved Trump in week 34 than week 15. One plausible explanation is that as the economy recovers from the covid-19 lockdown, more and more Americans disapprove Trump's covid measures and policies as they see second spike in covid-19 cases during the summer in the US. 


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

We used pivot_longer to transform the data. To remove observations that were not shared between the two datasets, an inner_join was used to combine them, as well as another inner_join to combine with the world bank data. We then added a region column to the world bank data. 

```{r, tidy_data}

# Used to put the HIV and life expectancy data into long format.
hiv <- hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = "1979":"2011",  values_to = "HIV", names_to = "Year")

life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = "1800":"2100",  values_to = "Life_Exp", names_to = "Year")


# Used to extract the observations, based on year, from the life expectancy data where observations are in the HIV dataset.
cleaned_life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.character(Year))


# Used to merge the life expectancy and HIV datasets.
hiv_life_expectancy <-  
  inner_join(cleaned_life_expectancy, hiv, by = c("Year", "country" ))

worldbank_data <- 
  worldbank_data %>% 
  rename(Year ="date") %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.character(Year))


# Used to join three datasets as well as add the region column.
worldbank_life_expectancy_hiv <- inner_join(worldbank_data, hiv_life_expectancy, by=c("country", "Year"))

worldbank_life_expectancy_hiv <- inner_join(worldbank_life_expectancy_hiv, countries %>% select(region,country), by=c("country"))

worldbank_extended <- inner_join(worldbank_data, countries %>% select(region,country), by=c("country"))

```

The relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy

There seems to be a negative relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy in most regions. However, in particular regions (North America, Europe & Central Asia) there is either very limited or a positive correlation.

```{r, HIV prevalence and life expectancy}

# Plot of the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy
ggplot(worldbank_life_expectancy_hiv, aes(x = HIV, y = Life_Exp)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  scale_x_log10()+
  labs(title = "HIV Prevalence vs Life Expectancy by Region",
    x = "HIV Prevalence (per 100 population)",
    y = "Life Expectancy")+
  theme_clean()+
  facet_wrap(~region)

```

The relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita. The graph can be intrepreted that when there is an increase in GDP per capita there is a decrease in women fertility rate. The slope of the relationship varies by region, as some countries have on average larger families. Reasons for the downward slope could be that as economies become more developed, there is a shift to employment of women within the workplace and less time to act as a care-taker for the family, which places constraints on the ability to have larger families. The higher cost of living in developed countries may also contribute to the reduced ability to have larger families due to financial considerations. 

```{r, fertility rate and GDP per capita}

# Plot of the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita 
ggplot(worldbank_extended, aes(x = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD/1000, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  scale_x_log10()+
  labs (title = "Relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita",
    x = "GDP per capita (in thousands)",
    y = "Fertility Rate",
    caption = " Source: World Bank")+
  theme_clean()+
  facet_wrap(~region)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format())


```

Regions that have the most observations with missing HIV data. 

According to the graph, Sub-Saharan Africa has the most observations with missing HIV data.

```{r, Regions with missing HIV data}

  group_by(region) %>% 
  filter(is.na(HIV)) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%

Relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate

The plot shows a negative relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate. The enrollment in a primary school leads to increased opportunity for women in the workforce which from our previous graph, we understand can lead to a reduced fertility rate. Having a child has many implications and the impact on the career of a women and the time away from work needed to bear a child can be a deterrent to having more children.    

```{r, primary school enrollment and fertility rate}
ggplot(worldbank_extended, aes(x = SE.PRM.NENR, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data

# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
bike
```


We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?
May and Jun in 2020 experienced a sharp decrease in the total counts per month (smaller total area of the curve) and a wider spread. The reducing total volume can be explained bu the lockdown which leads to more people working from home and less commuting in general. The wider spread, especially increasing number of days with more than 40K counts, can be explaind be the alternative effect as people start preferring biking over public transportation like bus or subway. 


However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?
Mean, as they are not far from being normally distributed.

# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook. We  load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. 

```{r}
#Downloading the data
data(yrbss)

# Examining the data 
glimpse(yrbss)
view(yrbss)
skim(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis


We first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. We use visualization and summary statistic to describe the distribution of weights. In addition, we find 1004 NA values. 

```{r, eda_on_weight}
# Analyzing the data regarding the weight
summary(yrbss$weight)

#Creating a variable without the missing values
yrbss_filtered <- yrbss %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight))

#creating a plot excluding the missing variables
ggplot(yrbss_filtered, aes(x=weight)) +

min_weight
sd_weight

paste("Given the statistics, we can examine that normal weight of high schoolers is around 64kg. However, some variablity is noticeable.")

  


```

Next, we consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. 
  
```{r}
# We create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

```

We provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week.

```{r, confidence interval}
#Calculating the proportion of students more than 3 days and less than 3 days of physical activities.
Stats_physical<- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

#We create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of high school that are not active 3 or more days per week. 
se=sqrt(Stats_physical$prop[1]*(1-Stats_physical$prop[1])/Stats_physical$count[1])
ciupper=Stats_physical$prop[1]+1.96*se
cilower=Stats_physical$prop[1]-1.96*se

#For testing purposes, We create also a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for the proportion of high school that are not active 3 or more days per week.
Bootstrapped_CI <- yrbss %>%
  specify(response = physical_3plus, success = "no") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")
percentile_ci <- Bootstrapped_CI %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci

```

We make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. 

```{r, boxplot}
# We create a boxplot to see a possible relationship between weight and physical activity.
physical_days_filtered <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus))

  ggplot(physical_days_filtered, aes(x=physical_3plus, y=weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs (title = "Relationship between high schooler’s weight and the physical activity ",
    subtitle= "Grades 9-12",
    caption="Source: Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, CDC",
    y="Weight (Kg)",
    x="More than 3 days of physical activities a week (No/Yes)"
  )+
  theme_clean()
  
  
  paste("The relationship between the two variables is not extremely clear. However, you can see the median weight of the high schoolers who are doing physical activies more than 3 days in a week to be higher. We were expecting it to be the opposite. However, this is potentially due to the fact that muscle mass does weight more than fat. Still, when looking at extreme values, the no category has higher and lower values. This could be due to the fact that it holds very obese people as well as people with potential mental diseases such as Anorexia")

```

## Confidence Interval

We  also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. We must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r}
#We compare the means of the distributions using a confidence interval.
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```
There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

We write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests. But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

We simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +
theme_clean()+
  labs(
    title = "Visualization of the null distribution",
    y="Count",
    x="mean differences"
  )
```


# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

We will explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

We will load the data and examine its structure first.

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

H0: The mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same.

H1: The mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same.

Resulting Test Statistics: t-stat > 1.96 (p-value of 0.05)
```{r spielberg_burton}

#create dataframe for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton's movies and calculate their corresponding stats values
movies_plot <- movies %>%
  group_by(director)%>%
  filter(director=="Steven Spielberg" | director=="Tim Burton") %>%
  mutate(count = n(),  #number of movies
         mean_rating=mean(rating), #mean
         sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE),  #standard deviation
         se_rating = sd_rating/sqrt(count),  #standard error
         t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),  #critical value of t
         margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rating, #margin of error
         upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating,  #upper bound
         lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating  #lower bound
         )
movies_plot

t.test(rating ~ movies_plot$t_critical, data = movies_plot)


```
t > 1.96 (p-value < 0.05), so we are rejecting the null.
we conclude that the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same.

Below, we will reproduce the pilot above. 
```{r Same Rating or Not}

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

This is used to load the data and view the omega.csv data.

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender

Calculated summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, created and printed a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval.

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval

subset_female = omega[which(omega $ gender == "female"),]
subset_male = omega[which(omega $ gender == "male"),]

sd_female = sd(subset_female $ salary)
sd_male = sd(subset_male $ salary)

mean_female = mean(subset_female $ salary)
mean_male = mean(subset_male $ salary)

n_female = length(subset_female $ salary)
n_male = length(subset_male $ salary)

margin_error = 0.05
t_critical = 1.66

standard_error = sqrt((sd_female^2 / n_female) + (sd_male^2 / n_male))
t_statistic = (mean_female - mean_male) / standard_error

observed_difference = mean_female - mean_male
lb_95_CI = observed_difference - 2 * standard_error
ub_95_CI = observed_difference + 2 * standard_error

summary_stats <- data.frame(gender = c("female", "male"), mean = c(mean_female, mean_male), SD = c(sd_female, sd_male), sample_size = c(n_female, n_male), t_critical = c(t_critical, t_critical), standard_error = c(standard_error, standard_error), margin_error = c(margin_error, margin_error), lb_95_CI = c(lb_95_CI, lb_95_CI), ub_95_CI = c(ub_95_CI, ub_95_CI))


summary_stats


```

After testing the null hypothesis of whether mean males salary equals mean females salary, we calculated a t-stat of approx 4, which is greater than the critical value of 1.66 with a 5% margin of error. 

As a result, we can reject the null hypothesis which means that the difference in mean salary estimated is different form zero.

With a 95% confidence interval, the difference between females' and males' mean salary is 12973 - 4443 = 8696.

We also can run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. We run the hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(123)

obs_stats <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means")

salaries_null_hyp <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))

salaries_null_hyp %>% 
  visualize(bins = 20, method = "simulation", obs_stats = obs_stats)

salaries_null_hyp %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stats, direction = "both")

```

From looking at both the t test and infer package, we can see that the probability of there being a difference between males and females salary is not equal to 0. Looking at the null distribution, it is clear that the difference between means of 8696 is on the tail of the distribution and an extreme value. We can also conclude that the difference is statistically significant when viewing the p value.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyzed the relationship between salary and experience and drew a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)

obs_stat <- omega %>% 
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means")

salaries_in_null_world <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("female", "male"))

salaries_in_null_world %>% 
  visualize(bins = 20, method = "simulation", obs_stat = obs_stat)

salaries_in_null_world %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat, direction = "both")

```

Using the two methods, the difference is statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval. The findings do not endanger the previous conclusion regarding differences in male and female salaries, since the experience may not being impacting salary. We must first conduct an analysis on the relationship between salary and experience to understand the implication. 


## Check correlations between the data

You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```


There appears to a larger amount of women entering the workplace recently, while the number slowly decreases until there are no female representation on the more experienced end of the plot. Reasons may be since pregnancy poses career trade-offs for women, preference to focus on more of a caretaker role at later stages in life, or ceilings in the workplace. As both genders gain further experience, the deviation in salary to experience is less apparent compared to men who have more fluctuation in the salary at particular experience levels. 

# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, yield_curve_1.1, fig1, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

yield_curve$var_f = factor(yield_curve$var, levels=c('3-Month Treasury Bill', '6-Month Treasury Bill', '1-Year Treasury Rate', '2-Year Treasury Rate','3-Year Treasury Rate','5-Year Treasury Rate','7-Year Treasury Rate','10-Year Treasury Rate','20-Year Treasury Rate','30-Year Treasury Rate'))

ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x=date, y=price, color=symbol)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~var_f, ncol=2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
         axis.title.x=element_blank(),
         axis.title.y=element_blank()
        )+
  labs(
    title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury Rates since 1960",
    caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
  )

```



### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, yield_curve_1.2, fig1, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

yield_curve_1998 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  mutate(month = month(ymd(date)))

ggplot(yield_curve_1998, aes(x=maturity, y=price))+
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol = 4)+
  geom_line(aes(group = month, color=factor(year)))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="U.S. Yield Curve", x="Maturity", y="Yield (%)", caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}

yield_curve_3_10 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  filter(var_f %in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"))
  

ggplot(yield_curve_3_10, aes(x=date, y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(color=var_f))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", x="", y="%")

```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
               cols="1970":"2017",
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to= "value"
               ) %>% 
  mutate(year= as.Date(year, "%Y"))

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

This last chart compares the change in the proportion of the various components of GDP over time for three countries (United States, India and Germany). Since the early 2000s, Germany has increased the proportion of its GDP from Net Exports (Exports-Imports) and now has one of the highest trade surpluses in the world - this is an indicator of economic strength and competitiveness. 

In India proportion of GDP from Household Expenditure has decreased sharply while there has been a sharp increase in the proportion of its GDP from Gross Capital Formation - this shows that the economy is growing quickly and investing in fixed asset (roads, railways, machinery, etc.) 

Lastly, in the United States the proportion of GDP from Household Expenditure has increased while the Net Exports decreased, implying that US is slightly relying more on imports of goods. Also,  proportion of GDP from government expenditure has been slowly decreasing since 1970, indicating the reduced size of US government and its fiscal decentralization approach in the country.
