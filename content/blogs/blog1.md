If you show that photo to most Canadians, they will be able to tell you where they were when it was taken. Crosby's golden goal is one of the greatest sports moment for Canadians. The moment took place during the Vancouver 2010 Olympics, when Canada was facing off against the United States, our close rival, in the final game for gold. 

Having the home ice advantage, the anticipation heading into the game was massive. After they dropped the puck at the beginning of the game, it didn't take long for Canada to score, quickly putting the pressure on the Americans. Canada then proceeded to increase the score to 2-0 and settled some of the nerves. 

However, complacency set in, and the Americans scored a goal. As the game was coming to a close, the Americans made a strong last push by pulling their goalie. With 25 seconds left on the clock, Zach Parise scores for the Americans. Watching this moment, I couldn't believe it, and the nation was in shock as we head into overtime to settle the game. 

In overtime, there were chances at both ends, but quick play between Iggy and Crosby created an opening that lead to the Golden Goal, as the team captain puts the puck past the American goalie. I was at home when watching and remember running around the house in celebration. To this day there has been no greater sports moment for me.
