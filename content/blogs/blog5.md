title: My adventures in Norway
---

When I was very young, I went on a cruise with my family and one of the destinations was Bergen Norway. Being from a fairly flat region in Canada, the mountains that surrounded Bergen provided some breathtaking views. I also thought the colourful wodden houses in the Bryggen area of town were interesting. 

When the time came to decide on an exchange destination in my bachelors degree, and I saw the new partnership my school had with the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen, I jumped at the opportunity. I remember the exciting feeling I had when I arrived in Bergen for my exchange, in a foreign country where I didn't speak the native language. The aspect on being completely on my own and forced to meet new people. 

Over my exchange I met lots of people from different countries, but also learned a lot about the Norwegian culture from my friends at the school. Norway is a more reserved and introverted society when meeting new people, so I joined the "innebandy" or what I viewed as ball hockey team to meet more locals.

My exchange provided many memorable experiences and I developed some life-long friendships with people from the country. The country will always be a second home for me after my experiences.
